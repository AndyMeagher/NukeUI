A comprehensive solution for displaying lazily loaded images on Apple platforms. 

It uses [Nuke](https://github.com/kean/Nuke) for loading images and has all customization options you can possibly imagine. It also supports animated GIFs rendering thanks to [Gifu](https://github.com/kaishin/Gifu).

The library contains two types:
