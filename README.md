# URLImage

A comprehensive solution for displaying remote images on Apple platforms. 

It uses [Nuke](https://github.com/kean/Nuke) for loading images. It has all customization options you can possibly imagine. It also supports animated GIFs rendering thanks to [FLAnimatedImage](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLAnimatedImage) and caching and displayng short videos as a more efficient alternative to GIF.

The library contains two types:

- `URLImage` for SwiftUI
- `URLImageView` for UIKit, AppKit, and watchOS
