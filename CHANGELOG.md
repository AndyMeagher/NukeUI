## NukeUI 0.5.0

- Rework `LazyImage` to use `FetchImage` on all platforms
- Add new `init(source:content:)` initializer to `LazyImage`:

```swift
LazyImage(source: $0) { state in
    if let image = state.image {
        // Use `AnimatedImage(image:)` if you need support for animated images.
        image
            .resizable()
            .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)
    } else if state.error != nil {
        Color.red.frame(width: 128, height: 128)
    } else {
        Color.blue.frame(width: 128, height: 128)
    }
}
```
